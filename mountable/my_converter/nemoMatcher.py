# matches a good but simple transcript of words to a bad transcript with good timestamps

# rough approach (left is good, right is with timestamps
# Ich,Ich(0:00,0:05)
# kann,kan(0:10,0:15)
# Ihnen,Ihnen(0:20,0:30)
# gerne, helpen(0:35,0:40)
# helfen,

# we always put all good words in and as many good timestamps as possible
# sometimes it doesn't fit. Then we just reuse timestamps and put lower confidence for the word

# For "Ich" we try to find a good match in the first few words of the timestamp file, we find Ich(0:00,0:05) and put it in the final csv
# "Ich(0:00, 0:05)" does not need to be matched again, so we move the pointer in the csv (a variable called 'j') ahead
# we move on to "kann" and find "kan(0:10,0:15)" via its low Levenshtein ratio difference. We put "kann(0:10,0:15)" in the final csv.
# same with Ihnen
# for "gerne" we do not find close match. We just steal the next available timestamp and put "gerne(0:35,0:40)" without moving the pointer in the timestamp file ahead
# thus we can match "helfen" to "helpen" as well, and put "helfen(0:35,0:40)

# note that this algorithm is far from final. The example solution might get outdated
